# Week 3: Building MVP

![MVP Illustration](image.png)

Week 3 focuses on helping partners build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Microsoft Azure. This phase is essential for establishing a working prototype that demonstrates core AI capabilities. By the end of this week, partners should have a functional AI application, laying the foundation for further development and scaling.

# Week 3: Goals

The primary objective of this week is to provide partners with hands-on experience in building an MVP leveraging Microsoft Azure services. This ensures they can move from concept to a functional prototype efficiently.

Key goals include:
- **MVP Development:** Equip partners with the necessary skills and resources to build an MVP on Microsoft Azure with minimal reliance on external support.
- **Practical Hands-On Experience:** Conduct real-world workshops and proof-of-concept (PoC) exercises that guide partners through the AI solution deployment process.
- **Integration:** Enhance the understanding of integrating Azure AI workloads into scalable solutions, setting the stage for future expansion.

# Overview
By the end of Week 3, partners should have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of their AI application. This stage involves designing, implementing, and validating a basic but functional version of the solution.

Microsoft provides structured guidance through reference architectures, hands-on workshops, and sample code to help partners build their AI solutions. This week’s sessions focus on AI model integration, Azure Data and AI workloads, and best practices for developing enterprise-ready applications.

## This week focuses on:
- Understanding AI reference architectures and solution accelerators.
- Participating in hands-on workshops to gain experience in AI MVP development.
- Utilizing sample code and pre-built templates to accelerate AI application deployment.
- Learning how to integrate AI models and services effectively into a scalable architecture.
