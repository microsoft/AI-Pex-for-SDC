In Week 3, we focus on enabling ISV partners to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Microsoft Azure. This includes providing reference architectures, hands-on workshops, and sample code to streamline the process. By the end of this week, partners will gain practical experience and confidence in developing AI applications with Azure AI, Azure App, and Azure Data workloads.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Empower partners to build an MVP independently using Microsoft Azure.
2. Provide hands-on experience through Proof of Concept (PoC) exercises for AI applications.
3. Enhance understanding of integrating Azure AI workloads into real-world solutions.

## Contents

### 1. Reference Architecture
We provide detailed reference architectures based on Microsoft's repositories and employee contributions on GitHub. These architectures serve as blueprints for partners to adapt and implement within their organizations. Partners are encouraged to discuss these designs with our teams for tailored guidance.

- **Sample Architecture Diagrams:**
  - Example from GitHub:

### 2. Workshops/Hands-On for PoC
We provide workshop and hands-on content designed to help partners experience the practical implementation of Azure AI workloads. These workshops guide partners through deploying and configuring AI-driven solutions step by step.

- **Key Activities:**
  - Deployment of conversational AI solutions using LLMs.
  - Integration of Azure AI and Azure Data workloads into MVPs.

- **Sample Workshop Resource:**
  
  GitHub Repository:  
  - [Chat with Your Data Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator)
  - [Aspire Shop with Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/vicperdana/AspireShopWithSK)
  - [Build your own copilot Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/Build-your-own-copilot-Solution-Accelerator)

### 3. Sample Code for MVP Development
To streamline the MVP development process, sample code is included within workshop materials. This reduces duplication and ensures consistency across all training sessions.

- **Internal Note:**
  If the workshops/hands-on content already includes sufficient sample code, there is no need to provide additional individual code resources.  
  For questions or clarifications:
  - **Japanese Version:** Covered by Makuroda.
  - **English Version:** Available for all relevant PSAs.

---

## Next Steps for PSAs
1. Review the reference architecture and workshop materials.
2. Conduct hands-on sessions with partners to guide them through MVP development.
3. Collect feedback to improve workshop content and adapt it to partner needs.

By the end of Week 3, partners should be equipped to independently build and iterate on their AI application MVPs using Azure, paving the way for scaling their solutions.
