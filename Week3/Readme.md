# Week 3: Building MVP
![Week 3 - Building MVP](Week%203%20-%20Building%20MVP.png)

Week 3 focuses on helping ISV partners develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Microsoft Azure. This week is designed to provide hands-on experience with Azure AI, Azure App, and Azure Data workloads, enabling you to build and deploy AI applications effectively.

# Week 3: Goals
As you begin your AI application development journey, creating a solid MVP is crucial for validating your ideas and demonstrating value quickly. This week's content is structured to help you build confidence in developing and deploying AI solutions on Microsoft Azure.

# Overview
This week is designed to provide you with the essential building blocks for creating an AI application MVP. You'll work with reference architectures, participate in hands-on workshops, and leverage sample code to accelerate your development process. By the end of this week, you'll have a functional MVP that you can demonstrate and iterate upon.

## This week focuses on:
- Understanding and implementing reference architectures for AI applications
- Gaining practical experience through hands-on workshops
- Leveraging sample code to accelerate development
- Building a foundation for scalable AI solutions

# Key Topics & Activities
## 1. Reference Architecture for AI MVPs
- **Session Objective:** Provide a blueprint for building AI applications using Microsoft Azure services.
  
- **AWAF4AI:** When you design AI workloads, the code and data that you integrate replaces deterministic behavior. This shift facilitates tasks like prediction, classification, and other functional goals. AI workload architecture can often be complex and must align with business constraints. The Azure Well-Architected Framework provides a solid foundation for architectural excellence, but you should also consider AI-specific design principles.

### Key Discussion Points:
- **Architecture Components:**

  - Azure AI Services for model deployment and management
  - Azure App Services for hosting applications
  - Azure Data Services for data storage and processing
  - Integration patterns between services

- **Best Practices:**
  - Azure Well Architecture Framework for AI (AWAF4AI)
  - Security and compliance considerations
  - Scalability patterns
  - Cost optimization strategies

### Hands-on Activity:
- Review and adapt the reference architecture for your specific use case
- Map out your MVP architecture using the provided templates
- Identify potential challenges and solutions for your implementation

## 2. Hands-On Workshops
- **Session Objective:** Gain practical experience building AI applications through guided workshops.

### Workshop Focus Areas:

#### General AI and Agentic Applications templates

- AI Apps templates
- Get started with AI application templates. Edit and deploy to Azure using VS Code or GitHub Codespaces: [AI Apps templates](https://azure.github.io/ai-app-templates/)

#### Conversational AI Solutions
- **Chat with Your Data Solution Accelerator**  
  Build AI-powered applications that interact with your data using Azure AI services.

### Hands-on Activity:
- Complete at least one end-to-end workshop
- Document your implementation process and challenges
- Share your learnings with the group

## 3. Sample Code & Development Resources
- **Session Objective:** Accelerate development with production-ready code samples.

### Benefits of Using Sample Code:
- **Rapid Development:** Jumpstart your project with pre-built components
- **Best Practices:** Learn from Microsoft-recommended patterns
- **Consistency:** Maintain uniform development standards across teams
- **Community Support:** Access documentation and community forums

### Available Resources:
- **Language Support:**
  - English: Comprehensive resources available
  - Japanese: Content in development (coming soon)

### Hands-on Activity:
- Clone and run a sample repository
- Customize the sample for your use case
- Document any modifications made

## 4. MVP Development Framework
- **Session Objective:** Guide partners through the process of defining and building their MVP.

### Key Discussion Points:
- **MVP Definition:**
  - Core features vs. nice-to-have features
  - Success metrics and KPIs
  - User feedback mechanisms

- **Development Approach:**
  - Agile development for AI applications
  - Version control and collaboration
  - Testing and validation strategies
