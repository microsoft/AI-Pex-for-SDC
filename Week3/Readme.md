In **Week 3**, our goal is to empower ISV partners to design and build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using Microsoft Azure. This week’s content is structured to give you hands-on experience with Azure AI, Azure App, and Azure Data workloads, preparing you to develop and deploy AI applications effectively.

---

## Goals

1. **Independent MVP Development:**
   Equip partners with the skills and resources to create an MVP on Microsoft Azure with minimal reliance on external support.
2. **Practical Hands-On Experience**  
   Offer real-world, step-by-step workshops and PoC exercises that guide you through the deployment of AI solutions.
3. **Seamless Integration**  
   Enhance your understanding of how to integrate Azure AI workloads into complete, scalable solutions.

## 2. Workshops and Hands-On Sessions  

Our **workshops and hands-on sessions** provide step-by-step guidance on building and integrating **Conversational AI solutions** using **Azure AI and Azure Data workloads**.  

#### Workshop Focus Areas:
**Conversational AI Solutions**  
Learn how to build, deploy, and manage conversational AI applications using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** on Azure.  

[Chat with Your Data Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator) – Build AI-powered applications that interact with your data.
[Build Your Own Copilot Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/Build-your-own-copilot-Solution-Accelerator) – Learn to create a **custom Copilot** using Microsoft Azure AI services.

**Azure Integration Techniques**  
Gain practical insights into **integrating Azure AI and Azure Data workloads** with your MVP.  

[Aspire Shop with Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/vicperdana/AspireShopWithSK) – Implement AI-enhanced shopping experiences using **Semantic Kernel**.

These resources will help partners **accelerate AI application development** and **gain hands-on experience** in building real-world AI solutions.
