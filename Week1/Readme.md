To achieve this, it's essential to engage in conversations and clarify the metrics for business growth. The content for Week 1 provides a pitch deck to aid in identifying growth opportunities and understanding. This pitch deck serves as the first step to discuss and confirm with the partner what workloads, including AI workloads on Microsoft Azure and other PaaS/IaaS workloads, are suitable after conversations about the partner and business growth opportunities.
