# Week 2: Design Thinking & Scenario Definition
![Illustration of a team of people doing design thinking workshop](image.png)
Welcome to Week 2 of our 5-week program for ISV partners. This week, we will dive into the world of Design Thinking & Scenario Definition. Design thinking is a user-centric approach to problem-solving that emphasizes understanding the needs and experiences of end-users. By keeping the user at the core of the design process, we can create innovative solutions that are not only functional but also desirable. This week, we will guide you through the principles of design thinking and help you envision solutions that align with your customers' needs and business goals.

## Design-led thinking
Design-led thinking is a **human-centric approach** that focuses on exploring challenges and issues from a people-first perspective. The design-led thinking approach:
  - Transforms your approach to problem solving, allowing you to determine the root cause.
  - Increases collaborative brainstorming, user adoption, and prototype design.
  - Helps you build deeper relationships with customers.
  - Reduces risk for new ideas and project changes.
  - Ensures the outcome meets the objectives and client requirements.

# Week 2: Goals
An envisioning workshop is the first step of deinining what the future of the your business can be. Design thinking combines creative and critical thinking, fostering ideation, and organizing ideas to drive decision making and situational improvements. At the conclusion of the workshop, the journey continues with the creation of a business case, technology roadmap, and change-management plan.

## Objectives & Outcomes
- Explore your business strategic priorities and current challenges
- Identify the your business' key initiatives that will align to the customer strategy
- Highlight the top initiatives that will bring in the highest value in the shortest time
  
# Overall process of an envisioning workshop
The envisioning workshop consists of two parts, the first part is the **Business Envisioning** and the second part is the **Capability Envisioning**. 

In the Business Envisioning workshop, Microsoft and the you, the ISV partner, get together to brainstorm, evaluate and prioritize the use cases to identify initiative to immediately collaborate on.

The Capability Envisioning workshop comes next for the you to understand what tools are available and choose the best approach to choosing your use case.

## Business Envisioning

The goal of the Business Envisoning workshop is to identify potential AI and GenAI use cases relevant to your industry and business. To identify problem statements, you can use these techniques: 
- **"Rose, Thorn, Bud"** to identify what is going well, what is not going well and potential opportunities,
- **"Clustering"** to group your ideas into clusters and themes, and
- Convert clusters into Problem Statements starting with **"How might we...?"**

If your organization already has a few AI use cases in mind that you have previously envisioned, please let your Microsoft contact know of these use cases. 

### Business, Experience, Technology Framework
The second goal of the Business Envisioning session is to evaluate and prioritize the use cases identified. We recommend using the **Business, Experience, Technology (BXT) framework**. 

You can read more about Business Envisioning and the BXT framework in this article: [Evaluate and Prioritize an AI Use Case with Business Envisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/dev/copilot/isv/Business-Envisioning).

Make sure that you have secured sponsorship from senior business decision makers for the workshop. This is critical to success. Secure a cross-section of business stakeholders including individual contributors and managers. It is very important to have the right stakeholders from your organization participating in this Business Envisioning workshop. Include these roles: executive sponsors, business unit or organization executives, business process owners and frontline associates.

## Capability Envisioning
After selecting a prioritized use case, it is time to decide how to develop it. ISVs can choose from three main approaches: extend or adopt a Microsoft Copilot, build a custom copilot, or create an application on Fabric. Learn more in this article: [Creating Generative AI Experiences with the Microsoft Cloud: A Guide for ISVs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/dev/copilot/isv/isv-extensibility-story).

These approaches are not mutually exclusive, but rather offer flexibility through broad spectrum of tools for developing your application. In the following section we explore how each approach fits into the development process, along with tools and considerations for choosing the best fit for your application. Our example scenario demonstrates the range of effort and resources involved in application development, while highlighting how your choice of approach can impact the development process.

These are the target audience for the Capability Envisioning workshop: 
- Chief information and technology officers
- IT and cloud administrators and DevOps roles
- Software developers and engineers
- Data engineers and scientists
- Enterprise architects

You can read more about Capability Envisioning in this article: [Choosing an approach to AI-enabled application development with Capability Envisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/dev/copilot/isv/Capability-Envisioning).

## Next step
The next step after the Envisioning Workshop is to have resource alignment both on the ISV side and the Microsoft side to build an MVP of the selected prioritized use case. We will cover this in [Week 3](https://github.com/msdaphne/AI-Pex-for-ISV-Partners/tree/main/Week3).
