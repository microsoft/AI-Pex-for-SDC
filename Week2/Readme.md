Welcome to Week 2 of our 5-week program for ISV partners. This week, we will dive into the world of Design Thinking & Scenario Definition. Design thinking is a user-centric approach to problem-solving that emphasizes understanding the needs and experiences of end-users. By keeping the user at the core of the design process, we can create innovative solutions that are not only functional but also desirable. This week, we will guide you through the principles of design thinking and help you envision solutions that align with your customers' needs and business goals.

## Design-led thinking
Design-led thinking is a **human-centric approach** that focuses on exploring challenges and issues from a people-first perspective. The design-led thinking approach:
  - Transforms your approach to problem solving, allowing you to determine the root cause.
  - Increases collaborative brainstorming, user adoption, and prototype design.
  - Helps you build deeper relationships with customers.
  - Reduces risk for new ideas and project changes.
  - Ensures the outcome meets the objectives and client requirements.

# Week 2: Goals
An envisioning workshop is the first step of deinining what the future of the customer's/partner's business can be. Design thinking combines creative and critical thinking, fostering ideation, and organizing ideas to drive decision making and situational improvements. At the conclusion of the workshop, the journey continues with the creation of a business case, technology roadmap, and change-management plan.

## Objectives & Outcomes
