Week 2 focuses on activities to concretely shape the partner's business growth opportunities and what they want to offer. We can provide envisioning workshops with Design-led thinking.

## Design-led thinking
Design-led thinking is a **human-centric approach** that focuses on exploring challenges and issues from a people-first perspective. The design-led thinking approach:
  - Transforms your approach to problem solving, allowing you to determine the root cause.
  - Increases collaborative brainstorming, user adoption, and prototype design.
  - Helps you build deeper relationships with customers.
  - Reduces risk for new ideas and project changes.
  - Ensures the outcome meets the objectives and client requirements.

# Week 2: Goals
An envisioning workshop is the first step of deinining what the future of the customer's/partner's business can be. Design thinking combines creative and critical thinking, fostering ideation, and organizing ideas to drive decision making and situational improvements. At the conclusion of the workshop, the journey continues with the creation of a business case, technology roadmap, and change-management plan.

## Objectives & Outcomes
- Explorer Customer’s/Partner’s strategic priorities and current challenges
- Identify the customer’s key initiatives that will align to the customer strategy
- Highlight the top initiatives that will bring in the highest value in the shortest time
